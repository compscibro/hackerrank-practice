Problem 10: Exposing Superman
Metropolis has a population n, with each citizen assigned an integer id from 1 to n. There's
a rumor that Superman is an ordinary citizen among this group.

If Superman is an ordinary citizen, then:
- Superman trusts nobody.
- Everybody (except for Superman) trusts Superman.
- There is exactly one citizen that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

Write a function expose_superman() that accepts a 2D array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi]
representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship
does not exist in the trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return the label of Superman if he is hiding amongst the population and can be identified,
or return -1 otherwise.
